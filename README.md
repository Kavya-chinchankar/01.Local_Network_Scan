Cyber Security Internship ‚Äì Task 1

Scan Your Local Network for Open Ports


---

üìò Objective

The goal of this task is to learn network reconnaissance by scanning a local network to identify open ports and services using Nmap. This helps understand how network exposure can lead to potential security risks.


---

üß∞ Tools Used

Nmap ‚Äì for network and port scanning

Command Prompt (Windows) ‚Äì to find local IP and run commands

Wireshark (optional) ‚Äì for packet analysis



---

‚öô Steps I Followed

1. Installed Nmap from the official Nmap website.


2. Opened Command Prompt and used:

ipconfig

to find my local IP address and network range (e.g., 192.168.1.0/24).


3. Performed a TCP SYN Scan using the command:

nmap -sS 192.168.1.0/24


4. Analyzed the Scan Results to identify:

Active devices on the network

Open ports and running services

5. Saved the scan output as a text/HTML file for submission.

üß† Interview Questions & Answers

1. What is an open port?
‚Üí An open port is a communication endpoint that listens for incoming network traffic.


2. How does Nmap perform a TCP SYN scan?
‚Üí It sends a SYN packet and waits for a response (SYN-ACK). It doesn‚Äôt complete the handshake, making it a stealthy scan.


3. What risks are associated with open ports?
‚Üí Attackers can exploit services running on open ports to gain unauthorized access.


4. How can open ports be secured?
‚Üí By closing unused ports, using firewalls, and configuring access control rules.
